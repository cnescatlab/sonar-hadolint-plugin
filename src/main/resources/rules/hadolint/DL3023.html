<h2>Rationale :</h2>
<p>
Trying to copy from the same image the instruction is running in results in an error.

<h2>Problematic code :</h2>
<pre>FROM debian:jesse as build
COPY --from=build some stuff ./</pre>
<h2>Correct code :</h2>
<pre>FROM debian:jesse as build
RUN stuff
FROM debian:jesse
COPY --from=build some stuff ./</pre>
