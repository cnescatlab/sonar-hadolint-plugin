<h2>Rationale :</h2>
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices.md#using-pipes">https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices.md#using-pipes</a></blockquote>
<p>Some <strong>RUN</strong> commands depend on the ability to pipe the output of one command into another, using the pipe character (|), as in the following example:</p>
<pre>RUN wget -O - https://some.site | wc -l > /number</pre>
<p>
Docker executes these commands using the <strong>/bin/sh -c</strong> interpreter, which only evaluates the exit code of the last operation in the pipe to determine success. In the example above this build step succeeds and produces a new image so long as the <strong>wc -l</strong> command succeeds, even if the <strong>wget</strong> command fails.
</p>
<p>
If you want the command to fail due to an error at any stage in the pipe, prepend <strong>set -o pipefail &&</strong> to ensure that an unexpected error prevents the build from inadvertently succeeding.
</p>
<p>
Since there are some shells that do not accept the <strong>-o pipefail</strong> option, it is not enough to add <strong>set -o pipefail</strong> inside the <strong>RUN</strong> instruction. Therefore, we recommend to always explicitly the <strong>SHELL</strong> before using pipes in <strong>RUN</strong>.

<h2>Problematic code :</h2>
<pre>RUN wget -O - https://some.site | wc -l > /number</pre>
<h2>Correct code :</h2>
<pre>SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-c"]
RUN wget -O - https://some.site | wc -l > /number</pre>
<p>Or in case of busybox in an Alpine image:</p>
<pre>SHELL ["/bin/ash", "-eo", "pipefail", "-c"]
RUN wget -O - https://some.site | wc -l > /number</pre>
