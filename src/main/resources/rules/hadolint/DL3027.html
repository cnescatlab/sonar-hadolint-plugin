<h2>Rationale :</h2>
<p>
<b>apt</b> is discouraged by the linux distributions as an unattended tool as its interface may suffer changes between versions. Better use the more stable <b>apt-get</b> and <b>apt-cache</b>
<p>
<h2>Problematic code :</h2>
<pre>FROM busybox
RUN apt install curl=1.1.0</pre>
<h2>Correct code :</h2>
<pre>FROM busybox
RUN apt-get install curl=1.1.0</pre>
