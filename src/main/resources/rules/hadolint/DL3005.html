<blockquote>Updates will be baked into the base images, so you don't need to run apt-get upgrade in your containers. Because of the isolation that happens this can often fail if something is trying to modify init or make device changes inside a container. It also produces inconsistent images because you no longer have one source of truth of how your application should run and what versions of dependencies are included in the image.</blockquote>

<blockquote>You should avoid <b>RUN apt-get upgrade</b> or <b>RUN apt-get dist-upgrade</b>, as many of the “essential” packages from the base images won’t upgrade inside an unprivileged container. If a package contained in the base image is out-of-date, you should contact its maintainers.</blockquote>

<pre>FROM debian
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade </pre>
<h2>Correct code :</h2>
<pre>FROM debian
RUN apt-get update</pre>
