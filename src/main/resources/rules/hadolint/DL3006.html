<h2>Rationale :</h2>
<p>
You can never rely that the <strong>latest</strong> tags is a specific version.

<blockquote>Tip: You recommend you always use a specific tagged image, for example ubuntu:12.04. That way you always know exactly what variant of an image is being used.</blockquote>

<h2>Problematic code :</h2>
<pre>FROM debian</pre>
<h2>Correct code :</h2>
<pre>FROM debian:jessie</pre>
<h2>Exceptions :</h2>
<p>When the image name refers to a previously defined alias:</p>
<pre>FROM debian:jessie as build
RUN build_script
FROM build as tests
RUN test_script
FROM debian:jessie
COPY --from=build foo .</pre>
