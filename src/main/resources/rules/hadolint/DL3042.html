<h2>Rationale :</h2>
<p>
    Once a package is installed, it does not need to be re-installed and the Docker cache can be leveraged instead.
    Since the pip cache makes the images larger and is not needed, it's better to disable it.

<h2>Problematic code :</h2>
<pre>RUN pip3 install MySQL_python</pre>
<h2>Correct code :</h2>
<pre>RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir MySQL_python</pre>
