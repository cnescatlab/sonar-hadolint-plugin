<h2>Rationale :</h2>
<p>
    Each <strong>RUN</strong> instruction will create a new layer in the resulting image.
    Therefore consolidating consecutive <strong>RUN</strong> instructions will reduce the layer count (see <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/dev-best-practices/">https://docs.docker.com/develop/dev-best-practices/</a>).
    In addition to that, each <strong>RUN</strong> runs in its own shell, which can be the source of confusion when part of a <strong>RUN</strong> instruction changes something about the environment, because these changes may vanish in the next <strong>RUN</strong> instruction.

<h2>Problematic code :</h2>
<pre>RUN command1
RUN command2</pre>
<h2>Correct code :</h2>
<pre>RUN command1 \
&& command2</pre>
