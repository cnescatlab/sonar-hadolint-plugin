<h2>Rationale :</h2>
<p>
Trying to copy from the same image the instruction is running in results in an error.
</p>
<h2>Problematic code :</h2>
<pre>FROM busybox
ENTRYPOINT s3cmd</pre>
<pre>FROM busybox
CMD my-service server</pre>
<h2>Correct code :</h2>
<pre>FROM busybox
ENTRYPOINT ["s3cmd"]</pre>
<pre>FROM busybox
CMD ["my-service", "server"]</pre>
<p>
<b>Warning:</b> Docker <b>CMD</b> does not process <b>$ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE</b>s, thatâ€™s a side-effect of using <b>sh -c</b> as the default entry-point. Using the JSON notation means that you have to figure out how to handle environment variables yourself.
</p>
<p>
<b>Warning:</b> The <b>CMD</b> exec form is parsed as a JSON array, so you <b>MUST</b> use double quotes (") instead of single quote (').
