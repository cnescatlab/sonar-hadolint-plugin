<h2>Rationale :</h2>
<p>
Trying to copy from the same image the instruction is running in results in an error.
</p>
<h2>Problematic code :</h2>
<pre>FROM busybox
ENTRYPOINT s3cmd</pre>
<pre>FROM busybox
CMD my-service server</pre>
<h2>Correct code :</h2>
<pre>FROM busybox
ENTRYPOINT ["s3cmd"]</pre>
<pre>FROM busybox
CMD ["my-service", "server"]</pre>
<p>
<strong>Warning:</strong> Docker <strong>CMD</strong> does not process <strong>$ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE</strong>s, thatâ€™s a side-effect of using <strong>sh -c</strong> as the default entry-point. Using the JSON notation means that you have to figure out how to handle environment variables yourself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Warning:</strong> The <strong>CMD</strong> exec form is parsed as a JSON array, so you <strong>MUST</strong> use double quotes (") instead of single quote (').
