<h2>Rationale :</h2>
<p>
    While <strong>COPYing</strong> to a relative path is not problematic per s√©, errors happen, when changes are introduced to the <strong>WORKDIR</strong> without updating the destination of the <strong>COPY</strong> command.
    Since it is easy to overlook this relationship, Hadolint emits this warning when no <strong>WORKDIR</strong> is set and <strong>COPY</strong> has a relative destination.
    This case is error prone and either setting the <strong>>COPY</strong>-destination absolute or the <strong>WORKDIR</strong> explicitly will reduce the probability of having an error.
    It is assumed, that when a <strong>WORKDIR</strong> is set, the programmer will make sure it works well together with the destination of the <strong>COPY</strong> statements.

<h2>Problematic code :</h2>
<pre>FROM scratch
COPY foo bar</pre>
<h2>Correct code :</h2>
<pre>FROM scratch
COPY foo /bar

or

FROM scratch
WORKDIR /
COPY foo bar</pre>
