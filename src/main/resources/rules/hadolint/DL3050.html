<h2>Rationale :</h2>
<p>
    In certain situations, it may be desirable to ensure no labels other than those specified in the label-schema are present.
    This may be required to avoid information leakage, to not confuse label parsers or to ensure compliance to standards.
</p>
<p>
    This rule is only activated when linting with the hadolint <strong>strict-labels</strong> option.
    This can be specified via config file :
    <pre>strict-labels: true</pre>
    or via command line:
    <pre>$ hadolint --strict-labels Dockerfile</pre>
    Note, that when no label-schema is specified, all labels are considered superfluous by this rule.
</p>
<h2>Problematic code :</h2>
<pre>FROM busybox
LABEL superfluous="this should not be here"</pre>
<h2>Correct code :</h2>
<pre>FROM busybox</pre>
