<h2>Rationale :</h2>
<p>
Switching to the root <strong>USER</strong> opens up certain security risks if an attacker gets access to the container. In order to mitigate this, switch back to a non privileged user after running the commands you need as root.

<h2>Problematic code :</h2>
<pre>FROM busybox
USER root
RUN ...</pre>
<h2>Correct code :</h2>
<pre>FROM busybox
USER root
RUN ...
USER guest</pre>
