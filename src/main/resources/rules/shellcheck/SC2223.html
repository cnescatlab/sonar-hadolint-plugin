<p>This default assignment may cause DoS due to globbing. Quote it.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">: ${COLUMNS:=80}
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">: &quot;${COLUMNS:=80}&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>This statement is an idiomatic way of assigning a default value to an environment variable. However, even though it's passed to <code>:</code> which ignores arguments, it's better to quote it.</p>
<p>If <code>COLUMNS='/*/*/*/*/*/*'</code>, the unquoted, problematic code may spend 30+ minutes trashing the disk as it unnecessarily tries to glob expand the value.</p>
<p>The correct code uses double quotes to avoid glob expansion, and therefore does not have this problem.</p>
<p>When quoting, make sure to update any inner quotes:</p>
<pre><code>: ${var:='foo'}    # Assigns foo without quotes
: "${var:='foo'}"  # Assigns 'foo' with quotes
</code></pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>None, though this issue is largely theoretical.</p>
