<p>ShellCheck only supports sh/bash/dash/ksh scripts. Sorry!</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">#!/usr/bin/python
print &quot;Hello&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>You have specified the shebang of an unsupported language or shell dialect.</p>
<p>ShellCheck only supports a limited number of Bourne-based Unix shells: bash, ksh, dash and POSIX sh.</p>
<p>It does not support scripts written for other shells like Zsh, Csh, Tcsh or PowerShell, and it does not support other scripting languages like PHP, Python, JavaScript or SQL.</p>
