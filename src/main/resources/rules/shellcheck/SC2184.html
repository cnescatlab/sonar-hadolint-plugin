<p>Quote arguments to unset so they're not glob expanded.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">unset foo[index]
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">unset &#39;foo[index]&#39;
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Arguments to <code>unset</code> are subject to regular glob expansion. This is especially relevant when unsetting indices in arrays, where <code>[..]</code> is considered a glob character group.</p>
<p>In the problematic code, having a file called <code>food</code> in the current directory will result in <code>unset foo[index]</code> expanding to <code>unset food</code>, which will silently succeed without unsetting the element.</p>
<p>Quoting so that the <code>[..]</code> is passed literally to <code>unset</code> solves the issue.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>None.</p>
