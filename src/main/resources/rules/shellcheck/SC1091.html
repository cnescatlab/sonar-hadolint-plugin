<p>Not following: (error message here)</p>
<p>Reasons include: file not found, no permissions, not included on the command line, not allowing <code>shellcheck</code> to follow files with <code>-x</code>, etc.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">source somefile
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<p>In case you have access to the file, e.g. if it is included in your source code repository:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh"># shellcheck source=somefile
source somefile
</code></pre>
<p>In case you do not have access to the file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh"># shellcheck disable=SC1091
source somefile
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>ShellCheck, for whichever reason, is not able to access the source file.</p>
<p>This could be because you did not include it on the command line, did not use <code>shellcheck -x</code> to allow following other files, don't have permissions or a variety of other problems.</p>
