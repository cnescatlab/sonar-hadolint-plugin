<p>This is a unicode quote. Delete and retype it (or ignore/singlequote for literal).</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo &quot;hello world”
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo &quot;hello world&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Some software, like OS X, Word and WordPress, may automatically replace your regular quotes with slanted Unicode quotes. The shell does not recognize these quotes and will not respect them.</p>
<p>In this case, you have slanted double quotes in a double quoted string. Try deleting and retyping them, and/or disable “smart quotes” in your editor or OS.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you want to use literal slanted double quotes for typographic reasons, you can put them in single quotes to make ShellCheck ignore them:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">printf &#39;Warning: “wakeonlan” is not installed.\n&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>You can also just [[ignore]] this warning.</p>
