<p>This is interpreted as a shell file redirection, not a comparison.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">[ 1 &gt;2 ] || [ 3&gt;&#39;aaa bb&#39; ] # Simple example of problematic code
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">[ 1 -gt 2 ] || [ 3 \&gt; &#39;aaa bb&#39; ] # arithmetical, lexicographical
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>A word that looks like a redirection in simple shell commands causes it to be interpreted as a redirection.
ShellCheck would guess that you don't want it in tests.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>When it's among a continuous list of redirections at the end of a simple <code>test</code> command, it's more likely that
the user really meant to do a redirection. Or any other case that you mean to do that.</p>
