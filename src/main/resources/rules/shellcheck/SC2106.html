<p>SC2106: This only exits the subshell caused by the pipeline.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">for i in a b c; do
  echo hi | grep -q bye | break
done
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">for i in a b c; do
  echo hi | grep -q bye || break
done
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>The most common cause of this issue is probably using a single <code>|</code> when <code>||</code> was intended.  The reason this message appears, though, is that a construction like this, intended to surface a failure inside of a loop:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">for i in a b c; do false | break; done; echo ${PIPESTATUS[@]}
</code></pre>
<p>may appear to work:</p>
<pre><code>$ for i in a b c; do false | break; done; echo ${PIPESTATUS[@]}
1 0
</code></pre>
<p>What's actually happening, though, becomes clear if we add some <code>echo</code>s; the entire loop completes, and the <code>break</code> has no effect.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">$ for i in a b c; do echo $i; false | break; done; echo ${PIPESTATUS[@]}
a
b
c
1 0
$ for i in a b c; do false | break; echo $i; done; echo ${PIPESTATUS[@]}
a
b
c
0
</code></pre>
<p>Because bash processes pipelines by creating subshells, control statements like <code>break</code> only take effect in the subshell.</p>
