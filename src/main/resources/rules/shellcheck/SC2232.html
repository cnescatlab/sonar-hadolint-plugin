<p>Can't use sudo with builtins like cd. Did you want sudo sh -c .. instead?</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">sudo cd /root
pwd
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">sudo sh -c &#39;cd /root &amp;&amp; pwd&#39;
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Due to the Unix process model, <code>sudo</code> can only change the privileges of a new, external process. It can not grant privileges to a currently running process.</p>
<p>This means that shell builtins -- commands that are interpreted by the current shell rather than through program invocation -- cannot be run with <code>sudo</code>. This includes <code>cd</code>, <code>source</code>, <code>read</code>, and others.</p>
<p>Instead you can run a shell with <code>sudo</code>, and have that shell run the builtins you want. Just be aware that what happens in that shell stays in that shell:</p>
<pre><code>sudo sh -c 'cd /root &amp;&amp; pwd'  # This shows /root
pwd                           # This shows the original directory
</code></pre>

<p>None.</p>
