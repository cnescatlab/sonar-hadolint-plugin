<p>Add &lt; /dev/null to prevent ssh from swallowing stdin.</p>
<p>The same error applies to multiple commands, like <code>ffmpeg</code> and <code>mplayer</code>.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">while read -r host
do
  ssh &quot;$host&quot; &quot;uptime&quot;
done &lt; hosts.txt
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">while read -r host
do
  ssh &quot;$host&quot; &quot;uptime&quot; &lt; /dev/null
done &lt; hosts.txt
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Commands that process stdin will compete with the <code>read</code> statement for input. This is especially tricky for commands you wouldn't expect reads from stdin, like <code>ssh .. uptime</code>, <code>ffmpeg</code> and <code>mplayer</code>.</p>
<p>The most common symptom of this is a <code>while read</code> loop only running once, even though the input contains many lines. This is because the rest of the lines are swallowed by the offending command.</p>
<p>To refuse such commands input, redirect their stdin with <code>&lt; /dev/null</code>.</p>
<p>You can also use command specific options like <code>ssh -n</code> and <code>mplayer -noconsolecontrols</code>.</p>
