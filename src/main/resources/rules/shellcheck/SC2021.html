<p>Don't use [] around ranges in tr, it replaces literal square brackets.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">tr -cd &#39;[a-z]&#39;
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">tr -cd &#39;a-z&#39;
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Ancient System V <code>tr</code> required brackets around operands, but modern implementations including POSIX, GNU, OS X and *BSD instead treat them as literals.</p>
<p>Unless you want to operate on literal square brackets, don't include them.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you do want to replace literal square brackets, reorder the expression (e.g. <code>a-z[]</code> to make it clear that the brackets are not special).</p>
<p>ShellCheck does not warn about correct usage of <code>[..]</code> in character and equivalence classes like <code>[:lower:]</code> and <code>[=e=]</code>.</p>
