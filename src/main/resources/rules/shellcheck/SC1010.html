<p>Use semicolon or linefeed before 'done' (or quote to make it literal).</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code>for f in *; do echo "$f" done
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>echo $f is done
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code>for f in *; do echo "$f"; done
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>echo "$f is done"
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p><code>done</code> only works as a keyword when it's the first token of the command. If added after a command, it will just be the literal word "done".</p>
<p>This is also true for other keywords like <code>then</code>.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If you're intentionally using <code>done</code> as a literal, you can quote it to make this clear to shellcheck (and also human readers), e.g. instead of <code>echo Task is done</code>, use <code>echo "Task is done"</code>. This makes no difference to the shell, but it will silence this warning.</p>
