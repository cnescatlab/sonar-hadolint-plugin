<p>The arguments to this comparison can never be equal. Make sure your syntax is correct.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">[ $var+1 == 5 ]              # Unevaluated math
[ &quot;{$var}&quot; == &quot;value&quot; ]      # Swapped around $ and {
[ &quot;$(cmd1) | cmd2&quot; == &quot;42&quot; ] # Ended with ) too soon
[[ &quot;$var &quot; == *.png ]]       # Trailing space
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">[ $((var+1)) == 5 ]          # Evaluated math
[ &quot;${var}&quot; == &quot;value&quot; ]      # Correct variable expansion
[ &quot;$(cmd1 | cmd2)&quot; == &quot;42&quot; ] # Correct command substitution
[[ &quot;$var&quot; == *.png ]]        # No trailing space
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>ShellCheck has determined that the two values you're comparing can never be equal.</p>
<p>Most of the time, this happens because of a syntax issue that introduced unintended literal characters into one of the arguments.</p>
<p>The left-hand side in the problematic examples will always contain (respectively) curly braces, pipe and trailing space. The right-hand sides are literal values and a pattern without trailing spaces, so they will never be equal. The statement is therefore useless, strongly indicating a bug.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>None.</p>
