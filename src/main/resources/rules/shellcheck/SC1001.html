<p>This <code>\o</code> will be a regular 'o' in this context.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh"># Want literal backslash
echo Yay \o/

# Want other characters
bell=\a
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo &#39;Yay \o/&#39;

bell=&quot;$(printf &#39;\a&#39;)&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>You have escaped something that has no special meaning when escaped. The backslash will be simply be ignored.</p>
<p>If the backslash was supposed to be literal, single quote or escape it.</p>
<p>If you wanted it to expand to something, rewrite the expression to use <code>printf</code> (or in bash, <code>$'\t'</code>). If the sequence in question is <code>\n</code>, <code>\t</code> or <code>\r</code>, you instead get a [[SC1012]] that describes this.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>None. ShellCheck (as of 2017-07-03, commit 31bb02d6) will not warn when the first letter of a command is unnecessarily escaped, as this is frequently used to suppress aliases interactively.</p>
