<p>ShellCheck directives are only valid in front of complete compound commands, like <code>if</code>, not e.g. individual <code>elif</code> branches.</p>
<h2>Problematic code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">if [ &quot;$prod&quot; = &quot;true&quot; ]
then
  echo &quot;Prod mode&quot;
# shellcheck disable=2154
elif [ &quot;$debug&quot; = &quot;true&quot; ]
then
  echo &quot;Debug mode&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<h2>Correct code</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-sh"># Applies to entire `if...fi` command
# shellcheck disable=2154
if [ &quot;$prod&quot; = &quot;true&quot; ]
then
  echo &quot;Prod mode&quot;
elif [ &quot;$debug&quot; = &quot;true&quot; ]
then
  echo &quot;Debug mode&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">if [ &quot;$prod&quot; = &quot;true&quot; ]
then
  echo &quot;Prod mode&quot;
elif  # Applies only to this [ .. ] command
      # shellcheck disable=2154
      [ &quot;$debug&quot; = &quot;true&quot; ]
then
  echo &quot;Debug mode&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>You appear to have put a directive before a non-command keyword, such as <code>elif</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>do</code>, <code>;;</code> or similar.</p>
<p>Unlike many other linters, ShellCheck comment directives apply to the next shell command, rather than to the next line of text.</p>
<p>This means that you can put a directive in front of a <code>while</code> loop, <code>if</code> statement or function definition, and it will apply to that entire structure.</p>
<p>However, it also means that you can not apply the directive to non-commands like an individual <code>elif</code> or <code>else</code> block since these are not commands by themselves, and rather just parts of an <code>if</code> compound command.</p>
<p>Please move the directive in front of the nearest applicable command that contains the code you want to apply it to, such as before the <code>if</code>.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>None.</p>
