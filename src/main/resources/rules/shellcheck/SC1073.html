<h1>Couldn't parse this (thing). Fix to allow more checks.</h1>
<p>This parsing error points to the structure ShellCheck was trying to parse when a parser error occurred.</p>
<p>Make any necessary fixes and check the script again, since most of ShellCheck's functionality can only be applied to scripts that parse successfully.</p>
<p>See [[Parser error]] for more information.</p>
